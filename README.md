## How the code works

This is a typescript react app that mainly uses MUI. Yarn should be used for node installations.

The compute is done is `ParametersContxt.tsx`. And the display is done in `MainPage.tsx`.

Please keep the size of each file small by breaking down things into sections, components, and util functions.

Run the website locally by running `yarn start` and run the tests with `yarn test`.
